#Voice-Powered Virtual Assistant
Description:
A sophisticated yet intuitive virtual assistant that leverages the latest in Python’s text-to-speech and speech-recognition capabilities to create a seamless, hands-free experience. This assistant utilizes the pyttsx3 library for smooth, customizable voice output and speech_recognition for precise command interpretation. Integrating Wikipedia for quick information retrieval, webbrowser for instant browsing, and os for native application control, it assists with daily tasks—from fetching summaries on topics to opening Google, YouTube, or specific applications like MS Word or VS Code. Date and time functionalities are powered by Python's datetime module, making this tool both a productivity booster and an engaging companion.
This project demonstrates practical experience with voice interfaces, natural language processing, and API integration, showcasing skills in Python-based automation and user-friendly design.
